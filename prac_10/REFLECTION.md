# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

    Usually my estimates were not very accurate because I often needed more time than I expected.
    I need to search some materials on school website for concentrating on some diffcult tasks especially in Kivy and inheritence,
    so I have to spend more time than I expected to finish my projexts.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

    I would say reviewing our class notes and some learning materials on school websoite is the most efficient way to improve 
    estimate accuracy, because I can have a firmer grasp of the knowledge points for completing the task quickly

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

    I learned that estimating is a skill that improves with practice. It helps me better manage time, break tasks into smaller parts 
    and understand my working speed. It also makes project planning more reliable.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

    I learned that feedback can reveal blind spots in my code. Other people pointed out things like readability, naming, and better ways to structure code.
    It helped me write cleaner and more maintainable programs.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

    I learned how to recognize good coding patterns and design.
    Reviewing others’ code made me more critical about my own style
    and taught me to explain suggestions clearly and respectfully.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/AshleyTXH10/cp1404praticals/pull/2#event-20753456615]()

### Explanation

    I pointed out improvements in variable naming and explained why they made the logic clearer. 
    I also suggested a more Pythonic alternative on function refactor.
    And I emphasis on required contant of magic number.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/Li-Zhengyuan/CP1404/pull/3]()

### Explanation

    I reviewed structure and provided feedback on simplifying repeated code.
    I explained the benefit in terms of maintainability and readability.
    And I emphasis on doing some error check on inputing, loading and something else
    Some docstring is needed to make code more readable.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

    More exercises are better.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

    The most important thing for me to do better is that I closely followed the pace of the class.
    I also documented my work clearly and tried different approaches instead of only using one solution.
